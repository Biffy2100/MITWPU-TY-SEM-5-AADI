Perfect! Here’s a **1-page super short AML cheat sheet** — everything in **1–2 lines per question** for quick memorization:

---

## **1. Basics of Machine Learning**

* **ML:** Computers learn patterns from data to make predictions without explicit programming.
* **Applications:** Spam detection, image/speech recognition, recommendations, stock prediction, healthcare.
* **Supervised ML:** Learns from labeled data. *Example:* Predict house prices from features.
* **PAC Learning:** Learns “probably approximately correct” hypotheses. *Example:* Spam classifier 95% accurate.
* **Model Selection & Generalization:** Pick best model that works on unseen data. *Example:* Test accuracy comparison.
* **Dimensions of Supervised ML:** Input/output size, complexity, model type.

---

## **2. VC Dimension & PAC Learning**

* **VC Dimension:** Max points a model can classify correctly. *Example:* Line separates 2 points → VC=2.
* **Importance:** Measures model capacity, helps prevent overfitting.
* **PAC Challenges:** Needs lots of data, computational resources, and assumptions about distribution.

---

## **3. Features & Feature Selection**

* **Feature:** Characteristic of data. *Example:* Age, height.
* **Feature Extraction:** Transform raw data into meaningful features. *Example:* Edges in an image.
* **Forward Selection:** Start empty, add best features iteratively.
* **Backward Selection:** Start full, remove least useful features stepwise.
* **Feature Selection Techniques:** Filter (stats-based), Wrapper (model performance-based).

---

## **4. Data Preprocessing**

* **Normalization:** Scale data to [0,1].
* **Scaling:** Change range to standard scale (Min-Max).
* **Standardization:** Zero mean, unit variance.
* **Managing Missing Values:** Imputation (mean/median), deletion, prediction.

---

## **5. Dimensionality Reduction**

* **PCA:** Reduce dimensions along directions with max variance. Eigenvectors = directions, eigenvalues = importance.
* **Kernel PCA:** PCA in high-dimensional space for non-linear data.
* **LDA:** Reduce dimensions while maximizing class separation. *Example:* Cats vs Dogs classification.

---

## **6. Midterm Numerical**

* PCA till eigenvectors: compute covariance, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, project data onto top components.

If you want, I can also make a **mnemonic/table version for advantages/disadvantages, features, and PCA** so you can memorize everything in **10 seconds per topic** for the exam.

Do you want me to do that?
