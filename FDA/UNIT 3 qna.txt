Got it 👍 Here’s a question bank for Unit 3 (Basics of Statistics) in Fundamentals of Data Analytics. I’ll cover definitions, short answers, and a few longer/conceptual questions so you’re exam-ready.

Question Bank – Unit 3: Basics of Statistics

1. Introduction & Types of Statistics-
    
Q1) Define Statistics. Why is it important in data analytics?
Q2) Differentiate between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics with examples.
Q3) What are the two main branches of statistics? Give real-world examples of each.


2. Basic Concepts in Statistics-

Q4) Define the following with examples:

Population
Sample
Parameter
Statistic
Variable


Q5) Differentiate between dependent and independent variables with an example.
Q6) What are extraneous variables? How do they affect experiments?
Q7) Explain the difference between continuous and discrete variables with examples.
Q8) Classify variables into Qualitative and Quantitative with suitable examples.
Q9) What do you mean by noise in statistics/data analysis?

3. Measures of Central Tendency-

Q10) Define mean, median, and mode.
Q11) When is median preferred over mean? Give an example.
Q12) Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the dataset: 5, 7, 7, 9, 10, 10, 10, 12, 15.
Q13) Compare mean, median, and mode in terms of sensitivity to extreme values (outliers).

4. Measures of Variation-

Q14) Define range, variance, and standard deviation.
Q15) Why is standard deviation considered better than variance?
Q16) Calculate variance and standard deviation for the dataset: 4, 8, 6, 10, 12.
Q17) Explain the importance of measuring variability in data.

Possible extraneous variable


Q22. Explain with an example how noise in data can affect statistical analysis.
Q23. Compare qualitative vs. quantitative data in the context of social media analytics.
Q24. Describe a real-life situation where inferential statistics must be used instead of descriptive statistics.
Q25. Why is it important to study both measures of central tendency and measures of variation when analyzing data?
